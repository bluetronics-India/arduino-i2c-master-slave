arduino-i2c-master-slave
========================

Code to accompany my article on Communication Between Arduinos Using IÂ²C

http://jamesreubenknowles.com/arduino-i2c-1680

This consists of two demonstrations, master-send and master-receive. 
Each demonstration contains two Arduino sketches, one for the master and one for the slave.
